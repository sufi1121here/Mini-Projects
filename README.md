# Mini-Projects
I am using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for my mini projects. HTML provides the structure, CSS adds styling and design, and JavaScript brings interactivity and dynamic functionality. These technologies together help me create engaging and functional web applications, enhancing my skills and understanding of web development.
